				<h2>
					Unit 5
				</h2>
				<p>
					The purpose of this assignment is to know the 		difference between an "ordered list" and an "unordered list" in html, and know the code to make them. It also lets you practice how to add hyper links in the "nav" element of the "body", and how to upload files to sftp and view the work on the production server. 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Create a new folder called 							"listsandlinks" in your repository folder.
					</li>
					<li>
						Inside listsandlinks create a 							file called "index.html" and a 							file called "main.css"
					</li>
					<li>
						In index.html create an ordered list of step by 						step instructions to create a new 							webpage on the production 							server.
					</li>
					<li>
						Also create an unordered list 							of 5 or more links to websites 							with useful webdesign related 							information.
					</li>
					<li>
						In the nav section, create an 							unordered list of links with a 							link back to your main index 							page.
					</li>
					<li>
						In your main index.html file 							in public_html, add an unordered list of links to 							the nav section with a link to 							"listsandlinks".
					</li>
					<li>
						Add an article with a heading 							and a paragraph description of 							this assignment. Also add an 							unordered list that contains 							this list of requirements. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Turn in your work.
